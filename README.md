# FlamekeeperBot Repository

This repository hosts the FlameKeeper Discord bot for the FlameBorn DAO.

The production-ready bot source lives inside the [`bot/`](bot/) directory so
that hosting providers like Render can use it as the service root
(`/opt/render/project/src/bot`).

See [`bot/README.md`](bot/README.md) for full setup, configuration, and
command documentation.
